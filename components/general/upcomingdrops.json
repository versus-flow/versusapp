  "aboutArtist": "Vector artist playing with geometry, composition and color to catch the eye. My work is based on these three principles, fed by avant-garde movements such as constructivism and cubism, adding my personal touch with futuristic, mythological or fantastic references. In my work I explore concepts under my visual perspective, exploring my mind and soul to express myself in an abstract way."
