    "aboutArtist": "Anxo Vizcaíno is a digital artist based in Lugo, Spain. Born in 1989, he quickly became a person of restless mind consumed by unanswered questions about reality, consciousness and mortality. Much of his recent work is personal art in which he explores these subjects. Intuition and spontaneous combination of concepts bring unexpected scenes about the universe, human experiences and our place in the vast cosmos. His visions are full of geometry and atmospheric backdrops, blending different techniques such as photo manipulation, animation and 3D."
