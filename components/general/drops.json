He has a personal passion for illustration and a love for drawing. \n\n He likes playing piano and composes contemporary music, good 50's movies, and Earl Grey tea. \n\n Occasionally he also fancies a bit of programming. Since he was a kid, he has flirted with technology and computer geekiness, which together with his interest in illustration has encouraged him to get involved with the creation of little multimedia pieces that often conceive as his personal artistic expressions."
