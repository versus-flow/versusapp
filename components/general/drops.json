He has a personal passion for illustration and a love for drawing. \n\n He likes playing piano and composes contemporary music, good 50's movies, and Earl Grey tea. \n\n Occasionally he also fancies a bit of programming. Since he was a kid, he has flirted with technology and computer geekiness, which together with his interest in illustration has encouraged him to get involved with the creation of little multimedia pieces that often conceive as his personal artistic expressions."

    "aboutArtist": "Blake Jamieson is a pop portrait artist in Brooklyn, NY. Originally from California, Blake's path to becoming an artist was far from a straight line. After studying Economics at UC Davis, Blake worked in digital marketing for nearly a decade. At the age of 30, Blake decided it was time to stop building someone else's dream, and follow his own path. Self-taught in the arts, but a veteran of brand-building, Blake built within the niche of professional sports. Blake has painted portraits for over 500 professional athletes in the NFL, NBA, MLB, MLS, and NHL. He is a licensed artist with Topps, where his art is printed on baseball cards. After discovering NFTs in early 2020, Blake again leveraged his marketing and community building skills to quickly build a name for himself in the NFT space. Blake has seen success with his individual NFTs, as well as collaborations with athletes like Terrell Owens and Dez Bryant, and is also the Art Director for Knights of Degen."

    "aboutArtist": "Jos is a digital artist and art curator from Buenos Aires, Argentina. His main interests when creating new works are surreal scenarios, dystopian imagery and the representation of our link with the cosmos. His works usually revolve around the same concepts: small figures living in solitude and surrounded by imposing scenarios in an attempt to portray the overwhelming beauty of the world around us in relation to an insignificant human presence in that context and at the same time visibly invasive. He began his journey in the NFT community as a digital artist in October 2020, and his works, mainly exhibited on SuperRare, are already in the hands of prestigious collectors around the world. As a curator, he focuses on the pursuit of artistic excellence with the goal of amplifying the voices of new generations of creators in the community. He is the curatorial mastermind and heart of Suspended Soul: through his analysis and dissemination of artworks by stellar emerging figures, he brings to life the conceptual ideas behind each collection, as well as crafting Suspended Soul's acclaimed curatorial reviews, which add value to the experience for artists and collectors alike."

    "aboutArtist": "Buba Viedma is a graphic designer and illustrator from Madrid. He grew up in a neighborhood and a time when going out after sunset meant coming home without shoes. It was much more practical to stay at home watching cartoons, reading and, of course... drawing. \n\n In 2003, he grew tired of washing towels in a hotel basement and thought that working in the graphics business would be better for his back pain than load 200kg washing machines. He then began a long journey through printers, design studios and advertising agencies, while continuing to train as an illustrator and doing freelance work for small clients. \n\n In 2011 he started doing these freelance jobs under the brand Mentecalamar Studio. Here he could enjoy different styles and graphic languages ​​without the plastic restrictions of doing it under a personal signature. And that's how in early 2014 he decided to bet on the studio and work on his own. In her spare time he cleans his house, does the laundry, cooks and fights against evil; although it is enough to watch the news to realize that he does not have much time for that."
